      description:"Margherita Pizza is a classic Italian pizza that highlights the beauty of simple, fresh ingredients. With a thin, crisp crust as the base, it's topped with a rich tomato sauce, slices of fresh mozzarella cheese, and fragrant basil leaves. Baked to perfection, this pizza is a tribute to the colors of the Italian flag—red (tomato), white (mozzarella), and green (basil). Perfectly balanced in flavor, it’s both light and satisfying, making it a timeless favorite for pizza lovers around the world.",
